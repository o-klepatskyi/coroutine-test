# Coroutine test

## TODO
- [x] Get the Debugger working with VS Code
- [x] Make simpler primitives for coroutines
- [x] Add unit tests for the coros to verify that they are working correctly and returning actual values
- [x] Create a thread_pool interface which simply spawns new threads, and integrate it into the working examples
