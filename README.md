# Coroutine test

## TODO
- [ ] Get the Debugger working with VS Code
- [ ] Make simpler primitives for coroutines
- [ ] Add unit tests for the coros to verify that they are working correctly and returning actual values
- [ ] Create a thread_pool interface which simply spawns new threads, and integrate it into the working examples
